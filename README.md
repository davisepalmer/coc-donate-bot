**Status Legend:**

- âœ… - Done and Working
- ðŸŸ¨ - Done but Needs Work (Bugs or Incomplete)
- ðŸŸ¥ - Not Started / Not Functional

### Notes

- We should also maybe look into changing the OpenBarracks to be abstracted so we just input 2 images and it clicks the first one based off of the second one
- I think we should code tests for all of the functions

### Helper Files

See `\helpers` and `mousecurrentpixel.py` for helpers and add them there

- also realized we can resize the CoC window with pygetwindow so that might make things ezier if we choose to hard code certain things if its faster

### Future Features

- Maybe we could add where someone on a Discord channel requests something and it trains it and donates it
  - built in training timers for when it reopens and such
